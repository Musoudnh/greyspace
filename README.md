# AriaHQ â€” Clean Static Preview (White Theme)

This is a **visual-first** static preview with a white, minimal UI and more charts (sparklines, bar chart, donut, progress) to reduce text/input clutter.

## What changed vs previous preview
- White background, fewer borders, softer shadows
- KPI cards with inline SVG charts
- Drivers as a horizontal bar chart
- Visual progress for approvals
- Kept copy minimal; moved emphasis to visuals

## Deploy
Open `index.html` locally, or push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel (Framework: Other, no build step).
