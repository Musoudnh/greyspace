# AriaHQ — Focus Static Preview (White, Minimal)

**Goals:** calmer white UI, fewer widgets, more visuals, lots of breathing room.
- Large combined hero chart (Revenue + GM%)
- Only two KPI cards on the first row
- “Top 3 things to know” replaces busy tables
- Visual approvals progress bar

Deploy: open `index.html` locally, or push to GitHub and deploy on Vercel (Framework: Other, no build step).
